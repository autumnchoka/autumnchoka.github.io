        <h1>Mystery Man ;)</h1>
        <h3>Io and her many men</h3>
        <p>Io Hartman, or should I say, Io Hearts-man is many things, funny, clumsy, and a little bit derpy, but most of all Io is a heart breaker. But that would all change after one fateful day, after meeting one amazing man after one day... </p>
        <p> One day Io Hearts-man was walking down the street, the maid, the myth the legend. Well, you'd be a fool to call her a maid it's true. Mistress suits her character better since shes been knocked up by over half the flag football team. Well anyway, she was walking down the street one day, I guess one would call it more of an alleyway, the kind where bad things happen and the kind where Io usually spends most of her days. </p>
        <p>She was walking past the same garbage can she did everyday for the past 10 years, when this man stepped out from behind it. He was not a tall man, nor a short one but was completely mediocre in every way. Well except for the less than acceptable haircut he had obviously done himself. He said hello and did a little bow. His voice was unsurprisingly high, about 2 octaves higher than a 3 year old girl but for some reason that didnt turn away Io oh no. If anything it made her more drawn to him. He was unlike anyone she had ever known, compared to all of the attractive dweebs she'd been with, this guy was a refreshing dweeb. </p>
        <p>Io was completely dumbstruck and for once in her life was completely tounge tied. She had nothing to say to this tiny man besides umm soooo and eventually, seconds after seeing him, without even knowing his name.... she blruted out the words she never thought she could. "I love You". </p>
        <p> Now this man had never seen anything quite as sad and desperate for love and atention as Io was and he immedietaly accosiated her to a sad abandoned hurt kitten. And boy did he love kittens. So he reached out a hand and took her trembling dainty ones, leading her out of the alleyway. </p>
        <p>They went into a starbucks, which Io was never able to aford unless she had just done a job and they were one of her highest paying customers. Needless to say Io was a little bit confused when the man bought her a starbucks drink and didn't ask for... how do I say this... anything in return. She chugged down her iced double whip carmel machiatto, with almond milk of course, and panting looked up at the man, or wait actually down since he was shorter than her. He looked into what he thought of at cat eyes and, like giving a starving cat milk, smiled and bought her another starbucks drink. This time it was a iced, sugar-free, vanilla latte with half soy milk and half almond milk.</p>
        <p>After Io's eye opening trip to starbucks with the mystery man, her view of the world was forever changed, she now could actually say words to the short mediocre man and she felt herself really starting to feel those three words she had said so uexpectedly before, I love you. Now this is where Io Hearts-man takes a sad turn for the worse... the mystery man left to go to his house without an explanation why. Io was so used to this so it wasn't totally unexpected but she couldn't help but feel a little let down because he was so much different than most of her clients.. I mean suagr daddyes wait no sorry men she knew. </p>
        <p> Although her dream mystery man she had fallen in love with had left her, it did give her the determination to get her life back together. She decided to acctually get a job instead of just giving them. She decided starbucks was where she wanted to spend her life. Working as a barista always had seemed so difficult and like too much work, but she decided she would attempt to serve people drinks and not throw them at the customers like she was used to when she felt jealous.</p>
        <p> So off she went to the Starbucks nearest her alley, and sat down at her walk-in interview. She couldn't pre call in to arrange one because of the lack of phones. it really was a miracle she managed to get as many well paying new customers as she did. She never had repeating or loyal clients because they would always see a picture of her sister and business partner and leave Io.  </p>
